This add-on allows you to set additional shortcut keys to rate your cards. Usually this is used for rating with the right hand (e.g. with hjkl) and 

a) ... you can configure whether pressing an answer key while you see only the question answers the card directly without showing you the answer (as the similar add-ons (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1212877655" rel="nofollow">Right Hand Reviews (jkl;)</a> and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1816717670" rel="nofollow">Right Hand Answer Shortcuts</a> do it). Or the answer keys can just unveil the answer (just as the 2.0 add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1310550323" rel="nofollow">Right-hand reviews with jkl;</a> did it). The latter is the default. 
b) ... you can configure the answer keys (defaults are "h" for 1, etc) from the add-on window.
c) ... you can configure if the meaning of the "2" and "3" key should be adjusted depending on the number of buttons you see. This will be less important once the V2 scheduler is no longer experimental but the default. Then you'll also have 4 buttons for new and learning cards, see <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/experiment-scheduling-changes-in-anki-21" rel="nofollow">this document</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dae/anki/blob/master/anki/schedv2.py#L149" rel="nofollow">this source code on github</a>. This is <i>disabled</i> by default.


<b># Configuration</b>
You can configure this add-on in the usual way for 2.1: Go to "Tools-&gt;Add-ons" (from the menu bar of the main window). In the window that opens select the name of this add-on in the list on the left, then click the button "Config" on the right side.

If you want to rate with the arrow keys use "Qt.Key_Right", "Qt.Key_Left", "Qt.Key_Down", "Qt.Key_Up". If you add a line [to this part](https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__jkl_answer_keys_configurable/blob/master/src/__init__.py#L81) of the source code of this add-on you should be able to use any key that the underyling toolkit qt knows. A list of all qt.keys can be found e.g. [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#Key-enum).


<b># Alternatives, useful other add-ons</b>
If you just want to remap the answer keys you could also have a look at  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/24411424" rel="nofollow">Customize Keyboard Shortcuts</a>. This add-on is also useful to remap other review related shortcuts like undo, bury, suspend, flag etc. Maybe also interesting: [Numeric Keypad Remapping â€“ ease bugs fixed](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/653807651).


<b># bugs, feedback</b>
If you find any bugs or have some feedback it's best to leave a message <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__jkl_answer_keys_configurable/issues" rel="nofollow">on github</a> or send a message via reddit to /u/ijgnord.
You can quickly confirm if it's working by checking how Anki registered the answer with add-ons like <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1354051622" rel="nofollow">Answer Confirmation for 2.1</a> or <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1008566916" rel="nofollow">Extended Card Stats During Review</a>.

<b># about about other right-hand/ hjkl add-ons</b>
There are many other add-ons for right hand answering. At the moment (2019-08-20) the ones I find all have some problem in my view:

1. <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2090822731" rel="nofollow">Handy Answer Keys Shortcuts</a> (2.0 only, last updated in 2013-07-06, 58 upvotes): I dislike how c is setup; rate from question

- when you press an answer button with add-ons 5. and 6. the cards is directly rated. So you can't use "k" to unveil and then rate. So no add-on for 2.1 offers to show the answer
- none of these add-ons support the 2.1 config dialog so that you can quickly change the keys.
- the add-ons 1., 2., 3. adjust the meaning of the buttons. The add-ons 1. and 3. have inconsistent behavior in my view. Among this pressing "l" on a three button card (like a learn card with the default scheduler)  when only the question is shown rates it as "good", whereas when you see then answer it's rated as "easy" (for details see below).


<b># about the "Handy Answer Keys" add-ons for 2.0</b>
The highly popular <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2090822731" rel="nofollow">Handy Answer Keys Shortcuts</a> (in 2019-08-20 58 upvotes and last updated in 2013-07-06) has this source code:

    elif key == "k":
        if isq:
            self._answerCard(self._defaultEase())  # is either 3 (for four buttons, review) or 2
        else:
            self._answerCard(2)

So the meaning of the button "k" changes: If you just see the question a review card gets rated as "good", if you see the answer it gets rated as "hard". 

You also have this:

    elif key == "l":
        if isq:
            self._answerCard(self._defaultEase())
        else:    
            self._answerCard(3 if cnt &gt;= 3 else cnt)

"self._defaultEase()" evaluates to three for four buttons, else two. So pressing "l" on a learn card when only the question 
is shown rates it as "good", whereas when you see then answer it's rated as "easy". 


The add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1848421740 rel=" rel="nofollow">Handy Answer Keys Shortcuts Amended</a> (in 2019-08-20 1 upvote and last updated in 2016-12-09) removes this ambiguity. But it still has this code:

    elif key == "l":
        self._answerCard(3 if cnt &gt;= 3 else cnt)

This means that the third key "l" means easy for learning cards but "good" for cards in review. So the meaning changes.


The add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1848421740 rel=" rel="nofollow">Handy Answer Keys Shortcuts Plus</a> (in 2019-08-20 0 upvotes and last updated in 2019-06-16) has the same key meanings as the original add-on from 2013.
